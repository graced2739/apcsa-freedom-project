The tool that I'm deciding to learn this year is GDevelop. My first choice was GoogleAppScripts and the idea for the project was a Gmail organizer along with other extensions of Gmail. But as I found the resources for the extensions, I realized that the code is just given to me, meaning that there is nothing for me to learn. And as I picked GoogleAppScripts last year, I want to use another tool and  make a game which GDevelop is great for. My game idea is a Java based platformer with minigames embedded between levels so it isn't too boring. I didn't want to make a regular platformer because anyone can make one so I decided it can be Java based so we can have a fun way to review for the AP exam. This idea is not 100% confirmed and I'll need to tinker a lot more to see what I can do with GDevelop. So far I was able to make a simple platform that my sprite can stand on, I was able to add animations to my sprite and make it turn right when you press the right arrow and turn left when you press the left arrow. I am also working with two other people: Bonnie and Yuki.

### Sources
This is the site with the Gmail extension tutorials: https://www.hongkiat.com/blog/apps-scripts-gmail-users/. In this website I was interested in learning how to Schedule Emails to Send in the Future, Snooze Emails, Convert Gmail Messages to PDF, Mark Archived Messages as Read, Find Unanswered Emails, etc. But as I clicked on the links for these extensions the code is already given and there's nothing for me to learn, I can just copy and paste it into GoogleAppScripts in Google Sheets, run the code and be done. That is why I switched to GDevelop. <br>

GDevelop has a lot of tutorials ranging from Beginner to Advanced along with tutorials on how to make a basic platformer, shooter and asteroid game. These tutorials are on GDevelop's YouTube channel: https://www.youtube.com/c/GDevelopApp/featured. Along with this GDevelop also has its own website where there are tutorials, extensions and all the other featured you can use: https://wiki.gdevelop.io/gdevelop5/tutorials. 

### EDP & Skills
Currently I am at Steps 1 and 2 of the Engineering Design Process which is Define the Problem and Research the Problem. Since I just confirmed my tool I need to learn it using the tutorials available. Until I'm proficient in my tool, then I can start making prototypes and plan out what each level should be along with what should be reviewed for the AP exam. One skill I need to use is how to learn because there is a lot of tutorials and it's easy to be overwhelmed so I will need to learn a little at a time but also make sure that the tutorials are actually necessary for what I have in mind. I should start at the beginner videos and slowly move my way up to advanced along with wriitng down what I learned into my notes so I can go back to it when I forget how to do something or remind myself what I should try or learn. The second skill I need is communication because GDevelop doesn't seem to allow collaboration so I'll need to ask my teammates what parts they are working on so I don't accidentally do the same thing they are. Also they aren't 100% sure on making a Java review game so I'll need to take their opinions into consideration on what they want to make.
