After finishing the Space Shooter game, to finish my MYP, I just needed to create the main menu. To do that I first created a new scene and named it `Main Menu`. After that, I just selected a background from the internet and created all objects for each game: <br>

As you can see here, me and my partners currently have 4 games. I created Space Shooter and the Wizard Game (see Blog 3), while my partner Bonnie created Flappy Bird and my partner Yuki created Dinosaur Game. After creating the appearance of the main menu, me and my partners wrote code so that players can click on the game they want to play and be transported to that specific game. Here is the code: <br>

After making sure that this code segment works, we need to make sure that we can quit the game we want to play and go back to the main menu. So to do that we went to the events of each game and wrote a line of code that allows players to go back to the main menu when they press the `Escape` key: <br>
Wizard Game: <br>

Space Shooter's menu:

As seen here, Space Shooter has a different code because I want Space Shooter to be able to quit back to the Space Shooter menu if the player wants to or accidentally clicks on a level they already played. <br>
That is basically it, our MVP is completed. For the future to make our game more polished, I'm thinking of adding more to the Wizard game or just delete it and create another game such as a Rythm Game or help my partners with any bugs that are coming up unexpectedly.

### Skills
The two skills I used was collaboration and communication. Due to the fact that my partners worked on their game in their own project space, I needed to let them know that before our MVP, they would have to transfer all their objects, background, and code to the main project titled `SEP12`. We also communicated when they decided to transfer their project as they had to go one by one or else the project would not save properly. By doing this, their projects were successfully transferred. We then also collaborated on the main menu with them writing code for their game and me writing for my game.

### EDP
The two Engineering Design Process I'm at are Improve as Needed and Communicate the Results. Due to the fact that my MVP is finished, I just need to add more details to the games I create or even create another one and make sure that that one does not have amy bugs. After being satisified with everything that I have done, and checking that my partners are also completely done with their parts, we can finally generate a new link to our game and present it to anyone who wants to see it.
