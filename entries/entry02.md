### Content
I have learned a lot about my tool. I learned how to create a score system where a value of 1 is added whenever the sprite collects/gets a coin. To create a score system I need to use `variables`. Variables are used whenever you want to store some information anout your game such as player's health or player's score. A variable exists in three spaces of Gdevelop: scene, object, and global. Scene variables are useful for things such as score levels for a particular scene. Object variables are useful for things such as enemy health that exists just for that enemy/object(sprite). And finally, global variables are used for things such as player selected username that exists everywhere within the project. For a score system, I would need a scene variable (I think that I would need a global variable if we were to create new scenes). <br>

Now to add a score system to my game I first need to go to [scene properties](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/73482933/207411670-1169fe78-1840-4d7f-a41f-6cd2df7e6ccf.png) <br>
