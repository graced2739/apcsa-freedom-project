I have learned a lot about my tool. I learned how to create a score system where a value of 1 is added whenever the sprite collects/gets a coin. I learned this from one of GDevelop's beginner tutorial which is about variables: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MFvAd-96LWo&list=PL3YlZTdKiS89Kj7IQVPoNElJCWrjZaCC8&index=4. To create a score system I need to use `variables` which are used whenever you want to store some information about your game such as player's health or player's score. A variable exists in three spaces of Gdevelop: scene, object, and global. Scene variables are useful for things such as score levels for a particular scene. Object variables are useful for things such as enemy health that exists just for that enemy/object(sprite). And finally, global variables are used for things such as player selected username that exists everywhere within the project. For a score system, I would need a scene variable (I think that I would need a global variable if we were to create new scenes). <br>

Now to add a score system to my game I first need to go to [scene properties](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/73482933/207411670-1169fe78-1840-4d7f-a41f-6cd2df7e6ccf.png) <br>
Next I will click on scene properties and then name the variable `Score`, make it hold a `number` and set it to 0. [Here is the image:](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/73482933/208219714-77f21646-3b64-49cf-840c-3e1118a30c9f.png) <br>
Now I can use the `score` variable in my events (events work the same way as if-statements, if something is true, something will run. If something isn't true then the code won't run). So when my character (an object), gets a coin (or collides into a coin), `score` gets added by 1. [Here is the image: <br>
