# APCSA Freedom Project
by Grace Dong

## Context
The “Freedom Project” for APCSA is all about selecting a specific tool used for coding and to create a project using that tool. The purpose of this blog is to walkthrough the tool I selected, why I selected that tool, how I learned the tool, and finally how I used that tool to create my project for APCSA.

## Content
For my project, I am making mini games with my partners Bonnie and Yuki for those who want something fun to do and relax. This blog will walk through my process of independently studying Gdevelop in order to make the mini games.

## Implications
Our project has positive and/or negative impacts on these categories: Global, Social, and Economic.
* Global: <br>
  *  Education: Our game can be distracting for students in class. They may just want to play the games instead of paying attention to their teacher or doing classwork.
  *  Environment: There are no negative effects for the environment since the game is online, but if players buy a new computer or phone just to play this game and discard their old device, then the environment is negatively affected if the old device is thrown into an landfill.
* Social: <br>
  *  Individual: Provides entertainment for individuals who are bored, want to find a way to destress or when they want to take a small break. A negative impact is that individuals may play the game for too long and neglect the work that they should be doing.
  *  Relationships: People can have friendly competition with their friends to see who has the highest scores. It may have a negative impact if players get too obsessive over beating their friends' high scores and may even cause fights.
* Economic: <br>
  *  Jobs: Our game can be distracting for workers. They may be playing the game when they are supposed to be working which creates issues in their jobs and may even get them fired in the worst case scenario.
