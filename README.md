# APCSA Freedom Project
by Grace Dong

## Context
The “Freedom Project” for APCSA is all about selecting a specific tool used for coding and to create a project using that tool. The purpose of this blog is to walkthrough the tool I selected, why I selected that tool, how I learned the tool, and finally how I used that tool to create my project for APCSA.

## Content
For my project, I am making mini games with my partners Bonnie and Yuki for those who want something fun to do and relax. This blog will walk through my process of independently studying Gdevelop in order to make the mini games.
